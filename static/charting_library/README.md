# TradingView Charting Library

[Demo][demo-url] | [Documentation][wiki-url] | [Tutorial][tutorial-url] | [Discord community][discord-url]

This repository contains the TradingView Charting Library package. If you use Git in your project, please feel free to use this repo as a submodule in yours.

The `master` branch contains the current stable version. 

The `unstable` branch contains the most recent features and fixes, but it can be less stable (actually, it's the beta, which is already thoroughly tested).

Please read [wiki][wiki-url] (at least the [Overview][wiki-url] and the [Best Practices][best-practices-url]) before using the Library.

### Issues Tracking
We use GitHub's [Issues tracker][issues-url] for our project. Feel free to create bug reports and features requests. Make sure to read the documentation before asking questions - this will avoid repeated questions, leaving us more time for developing the library.
